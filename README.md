NOTE this project has been discontinued, this is due to poor planning on my part as I rushed into the project without properly researching before development started. About 90% of the code would have to be deleted and completely remade using the improved systems. So instead of continuing this project, I am going to restart with a better plan for development under the repository, BetterEngine. This will be linked here once it is created.
