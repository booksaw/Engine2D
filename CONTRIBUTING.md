# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come together, any support is greatly appreciated.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Roadmap](https://github.com/booksaw/Engine2D/projects/3),  we use the GitHub projets tab to manage the roadmap of the project. 
  * Found a bug? [Issues](https://github.com/booksaw/Engine2D/issues/new/choose) use the issue tracker to report any bugs.

## Testing

A test package is contained wihtin the project, any code in there is not part of the final solution, but exists purly to test the solution in it's current state. Within this package, well documented code is not as crucial. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/booksaw/Engine2D/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
 
Thanks,
Booksaw
